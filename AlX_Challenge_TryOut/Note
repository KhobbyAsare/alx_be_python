The line:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

is a special Python construct used to **control the execution of code** when a script is run
directly vs. when it's imported as a module.

---

### üîç What it means:

* When a Python file is **run directly**, like:

  ```bash
  python explore_datetime.py
  ```

  then the special built-in variable `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`.
  So the block under `if __name__ == "__main__":` will **run**.

* When that same file is **imported** into another Python script, like:

  ```python
  import explore_datetime
  ```

  then `__name__` will be set to `"explore_datetime"` (the module's name),
  so the code under `if __name__ == "__main__":` will **not run** automatically.

---

### ‚úÖ Why it's useful:

It helps you write reusable code.
You can:

* **Run the script directly** for testing or standalone use.
* **Import it in other scripts** without triggering the main logic unintentionally.

---

### Example:

```python
# file: greetings.py

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hello()
```

* Run `python greetings.py` ‚Üí Output: `Hello!`
* Run from another script:

  ```python
  import greetings
  ```

  ‚Üí Nothing is printed, unless you call `greetings.say_hello()` explicitly.
