"""
Destructors (__del__):
When you create an object in Python, it occupies memory to store its data and code.
Objects are automatically destroyed (garbage collected) by Python when they are no longer in use or
when the program exits.

The __del__ Method:

The __del__ method is a special method in Python classes that gets called when an object is about to be
destroyed (garbage collected). You can define this method in your class to perform cleanup tasks or release
resources held by the object before it is destroyed.

Letâ€™s consider an example where we want to close a file automatically when the object representing that 
file is no longer needed.
